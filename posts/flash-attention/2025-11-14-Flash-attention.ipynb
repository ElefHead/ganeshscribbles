    "\n",
    "In this [2022 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135), the authors ask if efficiency in computing exact attention can enable transformers parse larger sequences and help overcome runtime and memory challenges for long sequences.  \n",
    "They note that   \n",
    "\n",
    "1. approximate attention techiques, a common approach to overcoming the quadratic time and space complexity of self-attention, tend to ignore overheads from memory access (IO speeds in GPUs).  \n",
    "1. as shown in [Ivanov et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00072), most operations on modern [GPUs are bottlenecked](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/perf/performance-bottleneck) by the [memory bandwidth](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/perf/memory-bandwidth) and fall short of using the available compute efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the authors argue for using operations that account for the reads and writes to different levels of fast and slow memory, i.e. introduction of IO-awareness in algorithms, on modern accelerators [(eg. SRAM vs High Bandwidth Memory in modern GPUs)](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-hardware/gpu-ram). With this, they focus on the attention computation to  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. reduce the number of memory access by computing the exact softmax without multiple accesses to the whole input. This helps speed up the forward pass during training as well as inference.\n",
    "1. not store the large intermediate attention matrix for the backward pass. This speeds up the gradient computation during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors introduce the `FlashAttention` [kernel](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/kernel) that uses [tiling](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-massively-parallel/9780323984638/xhtml/Ch005_93-121_B9780323912310000185.xhtml) to compute softmax over [blocks](https://modal.com/gpu-glossary/device-software/thread-block) of the input using a softmax reduction that enables both (1) the incremental calculation of the final softmax matrix without multiple global memory access, as well as (2) storage of block statistics instead of the large intermediate attention matrix for the gradient computation. This also allows for operation fusion allowing the calculation of output attention matrix in one kernel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "They further prove that `FlashAttention` requires $O(N^2d^2M^{-1})$ HBM accesses where $d$ is the head dimension and $M$ is the size of SRAM, as compared to $\\Omega(Nd + N^2)$ of standard attention."
